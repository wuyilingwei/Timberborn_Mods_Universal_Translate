You are now playing <i>Timberborn Early Access</i>.

The path ahead is exciting but bear in mind that the game is a work in progress. We keep adding new content and many existing parts of the game require further work. Bugs and crashes will happen. Please share your feedback using the <i>Go to feedback site</i> button or on the official Discord server.

If you previously played an older version of Timberborn, you may want to start a new settlement. The game evolves with each update and regularly receives new content and quality of life features, while some existing mechanics have been redesigned and work differently.

Good luck and remember to stay hydrated!",-

Tutorial.Stage.PlaceLumberjacks,"Welcome! This tutorial will help you with all the basics of building a beaver settlement.

Every new settlement needs Logs! Only lumberjacks will cut trees, so place two Lumberjack Flags next to nearby trees.",-
Tutorial.Stage.MarkTrees,"Lumberjacks will not start working until you tell them what to do. Use the Cut Trees tool to mark an area for cutting.

Hold down the mouse button to select multiple tiles at once.

A Lumberjack Flag only cuts trees within its range. You can check this by selecting a flag.",-
Tutorial.Stage.WaterPump,Beavers need water to survive. Build a Water Pump to ensure a continuous source of drinking water. Remember to connect it to a District Center.,-
Tutorial.Stage.Gatherer,"In addition to water, beavers also need food. Build a Gatherer Flag near some Blueberry Bushes.

Gatherers will automatically gather Berries within the flag's range. You can see the range by selecting the Gatherer Flag.",-
Tutorial.Stage.MarkBirchesForPlanting,"You can now plant trees. Choose the Plant Trees and Bushes tool and plant some birches.

Similar to crops, trees need to be watered in order to grow. Remember to mark them for cutting!",-
Tutorial.Stage.MarkCarrots,"Farmers will not start working until you tell them what and where to plant. Use the Plant crops tool to mark a carrot field.

Crops need to be planted on irrigated land. Otherwise, they will dry out and eventually die.",-
Tutorial.Stage.BasicStorage,"While all the buildings you placed have some storage, they will fill up quickly.

Build additional stockpiles for logs and water. Each storage building can only hold one type of resource. You can set it after selecting the building.",-
Tutorial.Stage.ExpandStorage,"With logs and water having a place to store, you should prepare the same for berries and the upcoming carrot harvest.",-
Tutorial.Stage.FinishLumberjacks,"The Flags will not be built unless they are within the district's building range.

Select the District Center to see its building range. You can extend it by connecting paths to its entrance.",-
Tutorial.Stage.ConnectLumberjacks,"Every building with an entrance must be connected to a District Center by a Path. Build Paths to connect the Lumberjack Flags to the District Center.

You can select the District Center to see its range along the paths.",-
Tutorial.Stage.Lodges,"Homes increase your beavers' well-being and allow your Folktails population to grow.

Build enough Lodges to house all your beavers.

Beavers will not reproduce unless there are empty slots for kits.",-
Tutorial.Stage.Inventor,Science Points are used to unlock more advanced buildings. An Inventor will produce Science Points over time.,-
Tutorial.Stage.WaterWheel,"We can now start producing more advanced resources, but some buildings require power to do so.

Build a Water Wheel by the shore on the river. It is dependent on the water flow, so it will stop producing energy when there is no water.",-
Tutorial.Stage.LumberMill,"It is time to start producing planks! Build a lumber mill and connect it to the water wheel with power shafts.

Many buildings can transfer energy to each other when placed wall to wall.",-
Tutorial.Stage.Farmhouse,"A settlement needs a stable food source. Build a farmhouse to plant and harvest crops.

If you are running low on workers, you can pause some buildings. To do so, select a building and click the pause button.

Like many other buildings, a farmhouse has a limited range.",-
Tutorial.Stage.Forester,We need a stable source of logs. Unlock the Forester and build it near a location where you want to plant trees.,-
Tutorial.Stage.KeepPlaying,"Your settlement is now self-sufficient as long as the water keeps flowing. Consider building a dam or placing more tanks to help your beavers survive the droughts.

The tutorial showed you the basics, but there is much more you can discover on your own.

Good luck!",-

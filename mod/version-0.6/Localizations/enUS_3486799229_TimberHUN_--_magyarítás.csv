You are currently playing the <i>Timberborn Early Access</i> version.

The road ahead is exciting, but remember that the game is still in development. We are continually adding new content, and many existing details require further work. Bugs and crashes may occur. Please share your feedback by clicking the <i>Send Feedback</i> button or on the official Discord server.

If you played an older version of Timberborn, it might be worth starting a new settlement. The game evolves with each update, regularly introducing new content and quality-of-life features, while some existing mechanics are being redesigned and behave differently.

Good luck, and don't forget to stay hydrated!",-

Tutorial.Stage.PlaceLumberjacks,"Welcome! This introduction will help you learn the basics of building a beaver settlement.

Every new settlement needs logs. Only lumberjacks can chop down trees, so place two Lumberjack flags next to the nearby trees.",-
Tutorial.Stage.FinishLumberjacks,"Flags cannot be built if they are not within the construction authority radius of the district.

Select the District Center to see its construction authority radius. You can extend this by building roads.",-
Tutorial.Stage.ConnectLumberjacks,"Every building with an entrance must be connected to a District Center by a road. Build roads to connect the Lumberjack flags to the District Center!

By selecting the District Center, you can view its range along the roads.",-
Tutorial.Stage.MarkTrees,"The loggers do not start working until you tell them what to do. Use the Tree Cutting Tool to designate an area for cutting.

The Logger Flag only cuts down trees within its radius. You can check this by selecting a flag.",-
Tutorial.Stage.WaterPump,Beavers need water to survive. Build a Water Pump to ensure a continuous source of drinking water. Don't forget to connect it to a District Center.,-
Tutorial.Stage.Gatherer,"Beavers need food near the water as well. Build a Gatherer flag near some blueberry bushes.

Gatherers will automatically harvest blueberries within the range of the flag. You can see the range by selecting the Gatherer flag.",-
Tutorial.Stage.MarkBirchesForPlanting,"Now you can plant trees too. Select the Plant Trees and Shrubs tool, and plant some birch trees.

Just like with crops, trees also need watering to grow. Don't forget to designate them for cutting!",-
Tutorial.Stage.MarkCarrots,"Farmers do not start working until you tell them what and where to plant. Use the Crop Planting tool to designate a carrot field.

Crops need to be planted in irrigated soil; otherwise, they will dry out and die.",-
Tutorial.Stage.BasicStorage,"Although every building you place has some storage capacity, they fill up quickly.

Build more warehouses for logs and water. Each storage building can only hold one type of resource. You can set it after selecting the building.",-
Tutorial.Stage.ExpandStorage,"After there is space for the logs and water storage, build a storage for the blueberries and the upcoming beet harvest as well.",-
Tutorial.Stage.Lodges,"The homes increase the welfare of the beavers and enable the population growth of the residents of Flower Valley.

Build enough huts so that every beaver has a place to live.

Beavers will not reproduce if there are no empty nesting spots for the kits.",-
Tutorial.Stage.Inventor,"You can use Science Points to unlock more advanced buildings. Over time, the Inventor produces Science Points.",-
Tutorial.Stage.WaterWheel,"We can now start producing more advanced resources, but some buildings need power for this.

Build a Water Wheel on the riverbank! It depends on the flow of water, so it stops when there is no water.",-
Tutorial.Stage.LumberMill,"The time has come to start producing the boards! Build a Sawmill and connect it to the Water Wheel with drive shafts.

Many buildings can transfer energy to each other if they are placed directly next to each other.",-
Tutorial.Stage.Farmhouse,"The settlement needs a stable food source. Build a Farmer's House for planting and harvesting crops.

If you have few workers, you can halt some buildings. To do this, select a building and click the pause button.

Like many other buildings, the Farmer's House has a limited range.",-
Tutorial.Stage.Forester,We need a stable log source. Unlock the Lumberjack building and build it where you would like to plant trees.,-
Tutorial.Stage.KeepPlaying,"Your settlement is now self-sufficient as long as the water flows. Consider building a dam or placing multiple tanks to help your beavers survive the drought.

The guide covered the basics, but there is still much more you can explore on your own.

Good luck!",-

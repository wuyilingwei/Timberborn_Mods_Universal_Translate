# Global Glossary for key vocabulary terms
# This file provides direct translations for commonly used game-specific terms
# Format: ["term_in_english"]
#         language_code = "translated_term"
#
# Advanced features:
# - Partial language definitions: Only define languages you need
# - Fuzzy matching: For terms with 10+ characters, allows character differences (configurable)
# - skip_hints flag: Prevent hints for specific terms (e.g., proper names)
# - fuzzy_tolerance: Number of character differences allowed (default: 2)
# - Language priority: Hints show only the first available language from config order
#
# Example with skip_hints (for proper names that shouldn't show hints):
# ["ProperName"]
# skip_hints = true
# translations = { zhCN = "专有名称", zhTW = "專有名稱" }
#
# Example with custom fuzzy_tolerance:
# ["LongTermName"]
# fuzzy_tolerance = 3
# zhCN = "长期名称"
#
# Note: Individual mods can override these with mod-local glossaries.
# See README for details on mod-local glossary structure.

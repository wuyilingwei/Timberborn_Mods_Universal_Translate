## Our rules

It uses both of AI and manual work, with AI responsible for providing translation support as quickly as possible and reducing workload, and manual work for proofreading and modification.

We are not responsible for the accuracy of the translated text.

The content that is not accepted for translation is:

 - Built in ID: These keys be used internally in the game. Modifying it may cause unpredictable modifications to the raw game and violate our "universal" principle. Players who do not install the corresponding mod may be modified.
 - Any content that violates public order and morals will not be translated to avoid potential problems. This includes but is not limited to: racial discrimination, adult content, etc.
